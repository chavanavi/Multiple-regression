# Multiple-regression
The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. A multiple regression model extends to several explanatory variables.

The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:
1.   There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables
2.   The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other
3.   observations are selected independently and randomly from the population
4.   Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance Ïƒ
